😄 Never knew coding with a team could be so much fun! I was responsible for implementing the UI for a patient table and its tools. Now all that's left is for the backend team to hook it up, which should be plug-and-play with the code I've set up~

Backend team provided me with data that I worked off of. After I was finished, my functions made it easy for the backend to connect events to the database.
